# C++ STL Container Implementations Hub

## Overview

This repository serves as a central hub for my from-scratch implementations of C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers. Each container implementation provides the same interface and performance characteristics as its corresponding `std::` counterpart, making them drop-in replacements for educational and learning purposes.

Key features across all implementations:

- Template-based implementations supporting any data type
- Full STL interface compatibility with standard containers
- Comprehensive unit tests for each container
- Educational focus on demonstrating data structure concepts and STL design patterns
- Containers build upon each other (e.g., Binary Tree → BST → Set/Map)
- Custom implementations of underlying data structures (lists, vectors, nodes) used where appropriate

Each container repository includes detailed documentation, usage examples, and test suites. The implementations aim to match the standard library's interface and performance characteristics while providing insight into the underlying data structures and algorithms.
